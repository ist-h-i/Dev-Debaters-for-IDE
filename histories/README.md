# Histories log guide
- Append one entry per phase (append-only; never overwrite).
- Use the template strictly and write concisely in English.
- Keep one persistent log per phase (e.g., `hearing.md`, `plan.md`); do not split logs by date so downstream improvement workflows see full history.
- The judge decides whether to move to the next phase after updating the log.
- Judges append directly at phase end (create the file if missing).
