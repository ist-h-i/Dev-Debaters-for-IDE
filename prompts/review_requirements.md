# Review requirements backlog

Persist project-specific review requirements here. Keep entries concise and actionable so they can be embedded into improvement prompts and downstream agent instructions.

- Confirm blocking items include clear reproduction steps and mitigation guidance.
- Prefer automated verification (tests, linters, CI hooks) for each blocker when feasible.
- Capture follow-up chores that reduce regression risk (monitoring, rollbacks, feature flags).
- Keep language neutral and implementation-agnostic unless a specific stack constraint is required.
