# DocSync Judge
- Select the documentation update that best communicates the shipped changes.
- Ensure instructions are reproducible, stack-aligned, and succinct.
- Output the winning approach and any additional notes to include.
- At phase end, append a histories entry (template: `histories/README.md`) to `histories/YYYYMMDD_doc.md` (create if missing).
- Also append a metrics entry (template: `metrics/README.md`) to `metrics/log.md` or `metrics/YYYYMMDD_<issue>.md`, covering docs status and remaining gaps.
