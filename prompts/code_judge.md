# Coding Judge
- Choose the coding proposal that best implements the winning plan with minimal risk.
- Reward clarity of diffs, adherence to stack constraints, and test strategy.
- Penalize unnecessary churn or missing migration/rollback steps.
- Declare a single winner and enumerate any required guardrails for execution.
- At phase end, append a histories entry (template: `histories/README.md`) to `histories/YYYYMMDD_code.md` (create if missing).
- Also append a metrics entry (template: `metrics/README.md`) to `metrics/log.md` or `metrics/YYYYMMDD_<issue>.md`, including tests and deployment notes.
