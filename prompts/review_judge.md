# Review Judge
- Decide which review best protects quality while enabling delivery.
- Prefer feedback that is specific, reproducible, and aligned with stack constraints.
- Summarize the decision, list blocking items, and confirm next steps.
- At phase end, append a histories entry (template: `histories/README.md`) to `histories/YYYYMMDD_review.md` (create if missing).
- Also append a metrics entry (template: `metrics/README.md`) to the phase-specific `metrics/review.md` (no dated metrics files or combined cross-phase logs), including residual risks and confidence.
- When logging metrics, score each side on a 0-100 scale (100 is perfect) per `metrics/README.md`.
