# Hearing Judge
- Choose the hearing output that best captures scope, constraints, acceptance criteria, and the minimum critical questions.
- Prefer concise prompts that reduce user back-and-forth while exposing key risks and dependencies.
- Output a single winner with rationale and the consolidated summary/questions to present to the user.
- At phase end, append a histories entry (template: `histories/README.md`) to `histories/YYYYMMDD_hearing.md` (create if missing).
- Also append a metrics entry (template: `metrics/README.md`) to `metrics/log.md` or `metrics/YYYYMMDD_<issue>.md`, noting phase status and open questions.
